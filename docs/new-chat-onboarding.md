# New Chat Onboarding Guide

## 🎯 **CRITICAL: Alignment Protocol**

### **Step 1: Establish Ground Truth Sync**

Before any development work, the AI must:

1. **Verify Live State**: Check https://energy.gsaboia.workers.dev is working
2. **Confirm Current Code**: Review actual file contents vs documentation
3. **Validate Architecture**: Ensure understanding matches reality
4. **Sync on Priorities**: Align on what matters most RIGHT NOW

### **Step 2: Decision Alignment Questions**

AI should ask these alignment questions:

```
## Alignment Check
1. **Current Priority**: What's the most important thing to improve today?
2. **Success Definition**: How will we know this session was successful?
3. **Constraints**: Any technical limitations or requirements I should know?
4. **Risk Tolerance**: Should I be conservative or can I make bold changes?
5. **Time Horizon**: Are we optimizing for immediate wins or long-term architecture?
```

### **Step 3: Ground Truth Verification**

AI must verify these before proceeding:

- [ ] **Dashboard loads and functions correctly**
- [ ] **Current year selector works (2020-2024)**
- [ ] **Tooltips show year-over-year changes**
- [ ] **All 6 energy sources display properly**
- [ ] **Worker health endpoint responds**

### **Step 4: Sync Confirmation**

AI should confirm alignment:

```
## Alignment Confirmation
Based on my analysis:
- Current state: [What I see working]
- Your priority: [What you want improved]
- My understanding: [How I'll approach it]
- Success criteria: [How we'll measure progress]

Does this align with your expectations? Any corrections needed?
```

## 🎯 **Quick Start for New AI Sessions**

### **Files to Add to Context (in order)**

1. **`README.md`** - Project overview, current status, tech stack
2. **`docs/development-cycles.md`** - Development methodology
3. **`docs/daily-planning.md`** - Current priorities and feature pipeline
4. **`public/index.html`** - Dashboard structure (if discussing UI)
5. **`public/script.js`** - Core functionality (if discussing features)

### **Standard Context Prompt**

```
# Energy Dashboard Development Context

## Project Status
This is a live Cloudflare Worker dashboard at https://energy.gsaboia.workers.dev
Current state: ✅ ENHANCED with monthly sources chart and country data (2023-2025)

## Development Approach
I use 3-level development cycles: hourly (tactical), 4-hour (feature), daily (strategic)
See docs/development-cycles.md for methodology

## CRITICAL: Alignment Required
Before any development work:
1. Verify the live dashboard is working
2. Confirm current code matches documentation
3. Ask alignment questions about priorities and success criteria
4. Get explicit confirmation we're aligned on approach

## Current Priority
[Check docs/daily-planning.md for current features in pipeline]

## Request
Continue implementing the most logical next enhancement based on:
1. Current feature pipeline
2. User experience improvements
3. Technical architecture evolution
4. Data expansion opportunities

Prioritize features that build on existing functionality and provide immediate value.
```

## 🔄 **Alignment Maintenance During Session**

### **Every Major Decision**

AI should confirm:

- "I'm about to [ACTION]. Does this align with your goals?"
- "I see [ISSUE]. Should I fix this now or continue with main task?"
- "This approach will [IMPACT]. Is this the right tradeoff?"

### **Ground Truth Checkpoints**

Regular verification points:

- After each code change: "Let me verify this works as expected"
- Before deployment: "Testing locally confirms [BEHAVIOR]"
- After deployment: "Live site now shows [IMPROVEMENT]"

### **Sync Recovery**

If alignment breaks:

1. **Stop immediately**
2. **Identify the disconnect**
3. **Re-establish ground truth**
4. **Confirm new alignment**
5. **Resume with caution**
