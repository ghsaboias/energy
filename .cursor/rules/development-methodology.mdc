# 3-Tier Development Methodology

Reference [docs/workflow-integration.md](mdc:docs/workflow-integration.md) for complete methodology.

## Cycle Structure

- **Task (Tactical)**: Specific task execution, immediate decisions
- **Feature (Strategic)**: Feature development and integration work
- **Daily (Planning)**: Daily planning and architectural decisions

## Documentation Requirements

- Update [docs/development-journal.md](mdc:docs/development-journal.md) for strategic planning
- Maintain task logs in `docs/task-log-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Follow templates in workflow-integration documentation

## Integration Rules

- Every feature: review task progress, consolidate decisions
- End of day: summarize features, identify patterns, plan next day
- Weekly: review all cycles, adjust development velocity

## Current State Tracking

Track active development phases and completion rates as defined in the methodology documentation.
