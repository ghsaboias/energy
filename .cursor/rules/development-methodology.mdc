# 3-Tier Development Methodology

Reference [docs/development-cycles.md](mdc:docs/development-cycles.md) for complete methodology.

## Cycle Structure

- **Hourly (Tactical)**: Specific task execution, immediate decisions
- **4-Hour (Feature)**: Feature development and integration work
- **Daily (Strategic)**: Daily planning and architectural decisions

## Documentation Requirements

- Update [docs/daily-planning.md](mdc:docs/daily-planning.md) for strategic planning
- Maintain hourly logs in `docs/hourly-log-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Follow templates in development-cycles documentation

## Integration Rules

- Every 4 hours: review hourly progress, consolidate decisions
- End of day: summarize sprints, identify patterns, plan next day
- Weekly: review all cycles, adjust development velocity

## Current State Tracking

Track active development phases and completion rates as defined in the methodology documentation.
