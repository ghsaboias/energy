# Development Time Tracking Integration

## Phase Management Commands

Before starting any development work, establish time tracking:

```bash
# Start daily session
npm run time start daily "Brief description of today's goals"

# Start hourly focused work
npm run time start hourly "Specific task description"
```

After completing tasks:

```bash
# End current phase
npm run time end

# Check status and recommendations
npm run time status
```

## Development Methodology Integration

Follow the 3-tier development cycle from [docs/development-cycles.md](mdc:docs/development-cycles.md):

1. **Hourly (Tactical)** - Specific task execution
2. **4-Hour (Feature)** - Feature development sprints
3. **Daily (Strategic)** - Architectural decisions

## Auto-Documentation

- Hourly logs auto-created in `docs/hourly-log-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Update progress sections manually after `npm run time end`
- Reference [docs/time-tracking-cli.md](mdc:docs/time-tracking-cli.md) for full CLI usage

## Time Awareness

- Check `npm run time status` periodically for phase duration warnings
- Transition phases when recommended (50+ min for hourly, 220+ min for 4-hour)
- Use timing data to inform development velocity decisions

## CLI Integration Pattern

```bash
npm run time start hourly "Task name"
# Perform development work
npm run time end
# Update hourly log progress section
```

This enforces temporal discipline while providing development context and automated documentation.
